### Project Description

VoiceForge is a groundbreaking, **voice-powered coding platform**  designed to empower developers—especially those facing **physical challenges**—to code hands-free and overcome traditional barriers. Built initially for Python and expanding to more languages, it transforms **spoken commands into code** so you can navigate, dictate, and debug effortlessly without the strain of typing. With cutting-edge tech like **Vosk** for offline voice recognition, the **CodeGen API** for real-time code conversion, and a sleek interface powered by **React and Tailwind CSS**, **VoiceForge** is not just a tool—it’s a revolution in accessible development.

Experience a new era where accessibility meets innovation. Loaded with special features such as **natural command dictation**, dynamic code navigation, and intuitive debugging, VoiceForge empowers you to build, create, and thrive without limits. And with future plans for **smarter AI integration**, multilingual support, cross-platform expansion, and customizable commands, the future of coding is set to be as flexible and forward-thinking as your ideas.

## The Problem Statement 🚨
Typing is a **major barrier** for developers with **disabilities**, those experiencing **wrist strain**, or anyone who wants a more intuitive coding experience. Traditional input methods limit accessibility and slow down workflow efficiency.

## The Solution 💡
VoiceForge enables **hands-free coding** using advanced speech recognition. Users can:
- Dictate code and commands 🎙️
- Navigate their projects with voice 🗂️
- Debug seamlessly 🛠️
- Work in a more **accessible and ergonomic** way 💻
